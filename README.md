Scripts that support various [Lichess4545](https://www.lichess4545.com/) community leagues by updating league spreadsheets with the latest results. The Series script also notifies players that their game has been picked up.

Currently runs every six hours for Series, Rapid Battle (group stage) and Infinite Quest on my local machine.

Check out the Lichess4545 [overview](https://bit.ly/35w1xqH) to learn more about these leagues. 

## Requirements

- Read/write access to each league's current Google Sheets spreadsheet
- [Series] A Lichess API token with msg:write permissions (see https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)
